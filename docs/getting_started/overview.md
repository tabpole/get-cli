# Docker Handbook

A simple and short Docker guideline

## Introduction

Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to develop, deploy, and run applications in a containerized environment. Docker provides an efficient way to package and distribute applications, making it easier to move them from one environment to another.

Docker uses a client-server architecture, with the Docker client communicating with the Docker daemon to manage containers and images. Docker images are the building blocks of containers and they contain the application and all its dependencies. Docker containers are instances of Docker images, and they can be started, stopped, and restarted as needed. Each container runs in its own isolated environment with its own file system, networking, and resources. This allows for consistent application behavior across different environments including development, testing, and production.

Docker has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its many benefits, including portability, scalability, and efficiency. With Docker, you can easily create, deploy, and manage applications, making it an essential tool for modern software development.
