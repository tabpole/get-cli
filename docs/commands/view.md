# Create view

The "get create view" command can be used to generate a new Dart file containing a template for a Flutter widget. To generate a new dialog widget in a file named "dialog.dart" in the "your_folder" directory of your Flutter project, you can run the following command.

```shell
  get create view:dialog on your_folder
```

This command tells "get" to generate a new dialog widget template in a file named "dialog.dart" located at "your_folder/dialog". The generated file will contain a basic template for a dialog widget that you can customize to fit your specific needs.
