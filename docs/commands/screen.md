# Create Screen

similar to the create page, but suitable for those who use Clean

The "get create screen" command can be used to generate a new Dart file containing a template for a Flutter screen. To generate a new screen in a file named "name_screen.dart" in the "lib/screens" directory of your Flutter project, you can run the following command.

```shell
get create screen:name
```

This command tells "get" to generate a new screen template in a file named "name_screen.dart" located at "lib/screens/name_screen.dart". The generated file will contain a basic template for a screen widget that you can customize to fit your specific needs.
