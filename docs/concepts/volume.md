# Docker Volume

A Docker volume is a persistent data storage mechanism that allows data to be shared and reused across Docker containers. It is a directory on the host or a remote file system that is mounted into a container as a file system. Volumes are independent of the containerâ€™s lifecycle meaning they can be managed and shared independently of the containers that use them. They provide a flexible and reliable way to store and manage persistent data in Docker containers making it easier to share and reuse data across different applications and environments.
