# Docker Registry

A Docker Registry is a repository for storing, managing and distributing Docker images. It provides a centralized location for storing and sharing images making it easier to manage and deploy applications across different environments. The most commonly used Docker Registry is Docker Hub, a public repository that provides access to a large number of pre-built images that can be used as the basis for building custom images. Docker also provides a tool called Docker Registry which allows you to set up your own private registry for storing and sharing Docker images within your organization.
