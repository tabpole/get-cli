# Docker Container

A Docker container is a lightweight and portable executable package that contains all the necessary files, libraries and dependencies required to run an application. It is created from a Docker image and runs as an isolated instance of the image with its own file system, network interface and system resources. Docker containers provide a secure and consistent runtime environment for applications and can be managed using the Docker CLI or container orchestration platforms.
