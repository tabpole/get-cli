# Docker Image

A Docker image is a pre-packaged, standalone and portable executable file that contains all the necessary files, libraries and dependencies required to run an application. Images are built using a Dockerfile which is a text file that contains a set of instructions for creating the image. Once an image is built, it can be stored in a Docker registry and used to create one or more containers that run the application. Docker images provide a consistent and reproducible way to package and distribute applications making it easier to deploy and manage software in a variety of environments.
